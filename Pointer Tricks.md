# Pointer tricks 
[[Pointers]] 
here are some tricks and hacks that i discovered and learned while coding. 

1. pointer to an integer: 

``` c
int *a = &b;
```

2. pointer to **a pointer to** an integer 

```c 
int **a = &p_z; 
```

this operation is costly as it requires two derefrencing operations
