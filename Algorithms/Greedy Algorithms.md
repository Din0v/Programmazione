# Greedy Algorithms 
They make decisions that look best at the moment, searching for a locally optimal solution, in the hope that this solution can be generalized.
but unfortunately not always optimal solutions are the best solutions!! 

[[Huffman coding]] is a notable example of a greedy algorithms that works well when generalized.
