# Armstrong Number
are numbers who satisfy this equation: 
if the number is comprised of 3 digits then: 
$$xyz \ = \ x^3 \ + \ y^3 + \ z^3$$
so for example: 
$$ 153 \ = 1^3\ + \ 5^3\ +\ 3^3$$

if the numbers are comprised of 4 digits the equation becomes:
$$ pqnr \ = \ p^4 \ + \ q^4 \ + \ n^4 \ + \ r^4 $$
this is a very good example to understand
