# Dynamic Programming
The solution for it are similar to [[Divide-and-Conquer]] method, in which we devide a problem into sub-problems, but the diffrenence lies in the fact that the subproblems are dependent on each other instead of being indipendent like [[Divide-and-Conquer]], and therefore more efficient!
