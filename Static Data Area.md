grazie.contains both **Global** and **Constant** variables. 

## 1. Global 
is a variable that lives outside all of the functions and it's visibile to all of them. it gets created when the program first runs and they can be updated freely. 

## 2. Constants
are *Also* created when the program first runs but they are stored in the **Read-Only** memory. they are similar to [[String]] Literals, as you will need them while the program is running but you don't want them to change.
