# Strcmp 
is a [[Functions]] that returns an **Int**, it compares two **strings** in input and gives one of three values:

1. 0: if the strings are the same hence there is no difference 
2. 0< (positive number): if the first string is bigger than the second 
3. 0> (negative number): if the first string is smaller than the second ( in [[[ASCII]] Values!)

the specific value of the number bigger or smaller than zero doesn't mean anything di per se !! ( it depends on the compiler ) it can vary between 1 t 32!

i encounterd this problem with codefoces 112A petya
