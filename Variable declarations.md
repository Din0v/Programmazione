#  STOOOOBID Mistake



Easy Mistake i did earlier while declaring multiple [[Variables]]  in a single line.


``` c 
    int column, row, index = 0;
```


this basically sets just the **index** variable to 0 and leaves the rest unset !!

1. to do it proprely you have to write it like this 

``` c
	int column = 0, row = 0, index = 0;
```

2. Or like this: 

``` c
	int column = 0, row = 0, index = 0;
```
