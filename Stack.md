# Stack 
The stack is the section of memory used for **local variable** storage.
everytime you call a function it's local variable are created in stack. 
variables are added to the stack when you enter the function, and get taken off te stack when you leave.

a stack is a [[Data Structure]] that can be implemented in [[Array]] or a [[Linked lists]], it is a sort of a bucket where the value you enter is added to the bottom

A stack is composed of several parts as follows:

1. the $Top$ is a pointer, which value is -1 if the 
2. the a void function $push$ // get's a value into the stack (staff it in )(سياسة الدحش)
3. the function $pop$ is the method of getting an item out of the stack ( imagine the sound of a *gas popping out*) or il versetto con la bocca

the stack is a good solution to store information about function calls
