# The analogy i came up with to explain programming as pieces of lego 


so it's like legos but way more complex as i have a gazillion amout of very different pieces, and hey i can create my own. 
yet the mechanism in which the pieces snap to each other is the essence of logic and the uniformity of the programming language.
