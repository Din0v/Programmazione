The make tool in gnu linux, helps in compiling and linking a huge project composed of many header files and includes many librarires. 

it uses a timestamp approach to know what to compile and what not to! 

you need to create it, and invoke it every time you need it. 

it requires two different parameters: 
1. the dependencies: (Which files the target is going to generate files from)
2. the recipe: (is the set of instructions needs to run to generate the files)
