# Why is the terminal emulator called as such ? 

using a computer ( a turning machine provide function of a terminal in **Software!!**)

it's just an archaic way of talking about the 1980s terminals that were used to communicate with the mianframes

so it can be thought of as me comunicting with the sage machine that is my PC hardware.
