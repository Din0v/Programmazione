# Header files Couriosity.

you can include a library or a header file using either ```<>``` or ```""``` they are basically the same thing.

the only difference being is how they are localized in the directory of your choice!

```<>``` : the **angular brackets** searches for system location for the header files!
```""``` : the **quotation mark** searches for current directory first!
