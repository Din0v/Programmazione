# A Useful analogy to source code 

when explaining to someone why open-source is important, bring up the analogy to a cooking recepie, if it's open you can modify it, and study it, and imporve it with minimal effort ( no reverse engineering ), and you can make sure it's safe and you aren't allergic to any of it's components.
unlike it's closed source counter part, which is effectively a black box.
