  # ctype.h 
  
  Is a header that is included in the OS. 
  
  i used it for the following command: 
  
   ``` iscntrl() ``` this function tests if the charchter is a control character or not 
   
   [[Control Characters]] they are characters in the [[ASCII]] table that codes start from 0 - 31 are all contrl charachters. and 127 is a control character
