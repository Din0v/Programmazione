# Loops - While & For

the *expression* is evaluated. IF it is a non-zero, the *statement* is excuted and the *expression* is re-evaluated.
this cycle continues until *expression* becomes zero, at which point excution resumes after the *statement*

The For statement
``` c
	for (expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )
		statement
```

is equivalent to 

``` c
	expr1;
	while (expr2){
			statement
			expr3;
		}
 ```
 
 This a common question when asked to convert between a for loop and a while loop 
 
 pretty common pitfall of mine
