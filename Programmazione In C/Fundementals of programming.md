# Fundementals of a Program 

- The basic operation of a computer will form an [[instruction set]] 
- A computer problem sends the **instructions** necessary to solve a specific problem 

- [[Fetch]] / [[Excute]] cycle aka **Life of a CPU**
	- Fetches and instruction from Memory  using [[Registers]] and excutes it [[Loop]]
	- A [[GigaHertz]] CPU can do this about a [[Billion]] times in a second $10^9$ a thousand million


### There are 4 steps that are fundemental that creates each program:

1. **Editting**: the ```.c ``` file that the programmer is working on. 

2. **Compiling** Converts the [[Source-Code]] into machine Language "[[Compilers]]"
			1. [[PreProcessor]]ing  		2. Generation of object code

3. **Linking**: Getting the dependecies such as librarires and generating the [[Excutables]]

4. **Excuting**: it's the stage were you run your own Program
