# CMD line Arguments
Is to pass data to my program while it's running via the terminal. 

- When ```main()``` is called by [[Run-Time]] system, two arguments are actually passed to the function:

1. The first argument:
```argc``` stand for argument count, which is an integer value that specifies the number of arguments typed on the command line

2. the second argument:
```argv``` for argument vector is an array of character [[Pointers]] (**Strings**).
