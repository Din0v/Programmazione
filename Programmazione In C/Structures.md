# Structures
also known as ```struct``` 

is a way in C to define a new datatype, that allows the combination of different kinds of data items 

it's just an Expanded [[Array]], in the sense that arrays can hold one type of data (all int, all float,... )

meanwhile Structures contain different types of *DataTypes* such as (int, char, floats, ...) all at the same time.
