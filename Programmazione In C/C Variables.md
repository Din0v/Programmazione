# Variables

- Variables hold [[C Data Types]] that may change or be assigned values as the program runs.

- Varaibles are the names you  give to the computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program. 

## Rules for naming variables: 
- All names **Must** begin with an underscore ```__ ``` or a letter, and can be followed by any combianations of lettes (*lowercase* or *Uppercase*), *Underscores* or digits.
 
==Valid Naming Schemes==
``` Jason, myFlag, i, J5x7, My_data, _shelikes```

==Invalid Naming Schemes==
``` Temp$value```: the $ is not a valid character 
```my flag```: embedded spaces are no permitted 
```3Jason```: variable names can **not** start with variables **WRONG**
```int```: int is a reserved word.
